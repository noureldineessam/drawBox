# Draw Box

This project can take an image to be uploaded and create boxes on it:

- Start by uploading an image(it might zoom in)
- Enable the draw mode toggle switch and start drawing boxes in any direction!
- Switch off the draw mode to be able to highlight boxes on hover and select boxes as well.
